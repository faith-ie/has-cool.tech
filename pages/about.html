  <h1>Soo uhm.. Hi.</h1>
  <p>I don't know why anyone would want to know more about me, as I am not really that interesting.</p>
  <p>But clearly you are interested.</p>
  <p>In case you clicked this page by mistake and didn't really want to know more about me, click <a href="../index.html">here</a></p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>What? You're still here? I guess you really do want to know more. Don't say I didn't warn you.</strong>
  <p>I was born in 2001 in Miami, Florida.</p>
  <p>Some of my hobbies include being shit at video games, programming, going outside, and watching movies / tv shows with my friends.</p>
  <p>I started programming in late March / early April of 2019, but I done v some light JavaScript / HTML / css from codeacademy when I was in middle school in 2013.</p>
  <p>Some of the video games that I enjoy playing are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Battlefield, Command & Conquer, and other games.</p>
  <p>I also really, really love reptiles. I used to have a leopard gecko named <a href="../assets/Lucy.png">Lucy</a>, who unfortunately passed away on October 31st, 2020.</p>
  <p>That's pretty much all I can think about now that would be interesting to people, if I think of more, I'll add it.</p>
